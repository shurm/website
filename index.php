				Let me tell you something. Pursueing dreams can seem extremely tough. So tough in fact that you may feel like giving up.
				But no matter how difficult one's pursuits are the most important things are to believe in yourself, and persevere.
				It is those two things that have helped me pursue my goals. 
				So no matter what the challenge, be it Computer Programming or Teaching I promise to give it my all and never give up.  
				...................... Oh and it's also just as important to have some fun along the way :). </p>
